# Sai-Fund-Raiser
Fund Raiser Smart Contract

This project is basically a fund raiser which collects the funds and pays them to the owner of the smart contract.
We have 4 different fund amounts. 
0.1ETH   0.5ETH  1ETH  2ETH
By connecting our wallet(Metamask here) we can donate the funds to the smartcontract.

And when the transaction is verified and confirmed by the blockchain, the latest transaction is then updated on the page, visible to all.

Being on Blockchain, every transaction is recorded and everyone can see all the previous transactions.
Here we have used goerli test network. We can deploy this smartcontract on real ethereum network also, provided with some ethereum and a node provider.
